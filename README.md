# FDA Academy Announcements
This python script scrapes the FDA Academy Announcements page (https://www.fda.gov.ph/category/academy-announcements/)
and prints the last N (5 by default) announcements including the title, link, and content. 
There is also a daily scheduler to run the script at the defined time.
